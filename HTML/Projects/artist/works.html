                <p>The Lantern Bearers <br>
                    First appeared on the cover of Collier’s Magazine in 1910.
                    This lively nocturne combines all the elements of the artist’s most successful works: fantastical characters, luminous color, and a sense of mystery. A tightly clustered group of clowns pose on a stage-like setting of wide stone steps, hanging glowing yellow lanterns against a silhouetted tree and a “Parrish Blue” sky. In the background hover four more golden orbs, leaving the viewer to wonder which, if any, is the moon. <br>

               <p> Daybreak <br>
                is a painting by American artist Maxfield Parrish made in 1922. Daybreak, inspired by the landscape of Vermont and New Hampshire to create lush and romantic tones,[1] is regarded as the most popular art print of the 20th century, based on number of prints made one for every four American homes. According to the National Museum of American Illustration, it has outsold Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans and Da Vinci's Last Supper. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_(painting)">-Wikipedia</a>
