                <h2>Origins</h2>     
                <p>I grew up in Northwest Arkansas in the Ozark mountains. My family was divided into two environments with one group hanging in the middle. I lived with my mother in town. This gave us minimal garden space and a yard to upkeep. My grandmother owned a hundred-acre farm where she raised horses, cattle, chickens and maintained a small vegetable garden. My father hung in the middle with just enough property to keep a mediocre garden and a small amount of livestock. I always loved growing and producing my own food. However, with the majority of my life spent in town, my opportunities to produce anything meaningful fell flat. It was a fun hobby that I would never let go of.</p>

                <h2>Military Life</h2> 
                <p>I took an eight year sabbatical from any kind of farming practice while I found my place in the world through the U.S. Coast Guard. It wasn't until after I was stationed at a small boat station in Michigan that i would re-light my farming fire. With the acquisition of 3 acres of land in the middle of nowhere and a flexible duty rotation, the gloves were off. I carved out a 20'x12' garden that produced more zucchini than should be legal and a whole lot of carrots and horned worm-eaten tomatoes. My experiment was plagued with powdery mildew, pests, weeds that I could not keep up with, and poor nutrient content in the soil. <br>
                    As I solved one problem at a time, I became proficient in soil building, composting, and pest control. These skills would become invaluable once I got an opportunity to begin hobby farming again. However, my duty rotation made it very difficult to keep on top of everything. If you can lay eyes on your crops every day, the work stays relatively minimal because you can immediately correct problems. With a 48-72 hour duty rotation, things got away from me very quickly.</p>

                <h2>Adjusting</h2>
                <p>Once separated from the military, I made due with what i had for a year. I lived in a rental for my first year after getting out; and that made a garden impossible. I settled into my job and began planning. I noticed very quickly that in the Charleston area of South Carolina that too much water, too little sun, and poor soil quality were going to be my big hurdles. This was a stark change from what I had in Michigan. In my area of Michigan, there were little to no trees the soil was relatively stable and nutritious and water ran very predictably. After a year I was able to buy a half-acre lot and a house that would come with its own set of issues. My first attempt &#40;the year I moved in &#41; was an expected flop. I moved too late to plant properly, and knew nothing of the property's behavior. 
                The next year was also a total flop because I didn't account for the water shed. this year is going slightly differently. We will have to see where it is at the end of the season.</p>

                <p>Today, I have 6 chickens, a 5'x12' garden, a mushroom tower, and two compost heaps. I am currently trialing 2 separate beds from my main garden, and a potato bin. The biggest challenge when producing is patience. If done right and without chemical fertilizers, it should take at least 2 years to dial in your property. Even then, there is always room for improvement. the addition of permanent crops like black and blue berries or fruit trees is also a fantastic thing to include in any home set up.</p>
