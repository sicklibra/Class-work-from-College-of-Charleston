                <h2>Raisin' Livestock!</h2>
                <p>The easiest and possibly more difficult place to start is chickens. My city allows up to 10 chickens as long as they cannot run wild. Chickens are relatively low maintenance, grow fast, and, if you get the right breed, incredibly productive. Before purchasing chickens for eggs, know that once they start laying, many breeds will produce upwards of 250 eggs per year per hen for around 5 years. If you are raising them for meat, they will be of appropriate size in about 18 weeks. Be warned if you are raising meat birds, they are incredibly cute and funny animals and you may not be able to bring yourself to eat them.</p>

                <h2>Benefits of Raising Chickens</h2>
               <ul>
                <li>They are Low Maintenance. <br>
                    It's mostly keeping their food and water clean and closing them in every night and letting them out every morning.
                </li>
                <li>They are Little Garbage Disposals. <br>
                The list of things you can't feed chickens is very short and they love Kitchen scraps.</li>
                <li>Their Poo is Nutrient Rich <br>
                Chicken poo is incredibly rich in nitrogen and Phosphorus. The bedding from chicken coop clean up makes outstanding compost especially if you use wood shaving bedding &#40;NOT CEDAR&#41;</li>
                <li>They are Great Exterminators. <br>
                If you have the set up and clip their wings so they don't bother the neighbors, you can let them loose throughout the day once they have acclimated to their coop. These guys have nothing better to do than eat every bug that ever thought about entering your yard. They will also attack squirrels and eat small snakes. Miniature dinosaurs is an accurate description. You can also build them a mobile run and allow them to clean specific areas of your yard. </li>
                <li>Chicken Feed is Cheap. <br>
                With 6 chickens only eating about a cup of food a day each, a small flock will only eat about a bag of feed a month. A 50lb bag runs around $20 at the time im writing this.</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Drawbacks of Chickens</h2>
               <ul>
                <li>The Initial Cost is High. <br> 
                While the chickens themselves run about $6 a chick, chicken wire is not cheap and nor are pre made coops. There are tons of pre made coops you can buy with built in runs; but if you're the do-it-yourself type, plans and materials will give you more bang for your buck.</li>
                <li>You Still Have to Clean Up <br>
                like most livestock, chickens are not very smart and are very messy. If you keep their food and water in a small coop with them, you will be cleaning alot of poop out of thier feeder and water. Bedding in the coop will also need to be cleaned out periodically. With great compost comes great responsibility. when the coop begins to stink, it's time to swap the bedding.</li>
                <li>They Are an Unruly Bunch. <br>
                Though domesticated to a point, chickens are still pretty ferral creatures. They will almost always run from you which makes catching them outside of bed time an arduous task that takes skill and coordination. </li>
                <li>Chickens are Prey. <br>
                Though they are tough and hearty, chickens are still a prey animal and can be snapped up by a hungry bird of prey, fox, stray dog, or, if you live far enough south, can be eaten by large snakes.</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Other Animals</h2>
               <p>There are a marriad of different farm animals that you can get away with having under certain circumstances. However, most city ordinances prevent having hooved animals in town. That said, I will not go in depth about the other animals but I can touch on a few.</p>
                <h3>Rabbits</h3>
            <p>Rabbits are easy but offer little in the value of home production unless you get a few cashmire rabbits for their fur. They are easy to keep and feed but don't produce much meat. One huge advantage, however, is that their poo is special and known by many farmers as brown gold. Rabbit manure can be added to a garden without composting. The nitrogen left behind will make your plants explode. To my knowlege it is impossible to overdo it with rabbit manure.</p>
            <h3>Pigs</h3>
            <p>You may be able to get away with one pig as a pet in town. A large pig can produce a couple hundred pounds of meat. That said, actual pet pigs tend to be pretty small and wouldnt produce much meat. They do have intelligence rivaling domesticated dogs though.</p>
           <div id="goat"> <h3>Goats</h3>
            <p>Goats tend to be great companions and will eat EVERYTHING. Keep them away from anything you don't want scrubbed from the face of the earth. The benefit of keeping a goat or two, if you can, is that if you can get one producing milk, they will provide a very nutritious base for cheeses, butter, and cooking.</p>
