                <h2 id="start">Gardening Where to Start</h2>
                <p>When planning a garden, you can't just plop one anywhere. You must always take your environment into account. When you get a heavy rain spell it is paramount that you watch where your water collects and what dries out quickly on your property. My first run in my current plot, I lost 80% of my garden to root rot. Water logged carrots are not pleasant at all. You must also research what grows well in your area. The different types of soil make a <b>HUGE</b> impact on your crops production. The last thing you have to take into account is how much light you get. I would never say "don't try" but I would caution against putting too much work into an area that won't produce. Lastly know your seasons and the behavior of the plants you intend to grow.</p>

                <h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
                <p><b>Expect your first year to be a wash.</b>Failure is not saying that you are bad at it. There are simply lessons that must be learned the hard way and trial and error is the best way to get the answers you need. There are some mitigating steps that you can take:</p>
                    <h2>1. Gage your Light</h2>
                     Most of the time you are going to want to pick a place in the yard that gets the most sun. 6hrs a day is the minimum for full sun which most crops require. The best way to find this out is marking time through the growing season. Note the time that the sun covers your planned spot and the time the sun leaves it. Depending on where trees or structures are in your area can change these times drastically through the growing season as the sun angle changes through the summer.

                    <h2>2. Watch Your Water</h2>                
                    Rainy days are a bit depressing to begin with. It is made so much worse when you watch the water pool up around your plants and eventually submerge a portion of them. In places that get heavy rains, no matter how infrequent, it is important to watch where your water runs and stands. Root rot is a killer and will destroy an entire garden in just a couple of days. In 2022 two rounds of my zucchini were killed by root rot. My carrots looked to be doing well until I went to pull one and the center pulled free from a puddle of orange goo. The spot you choose may need to be built up a little to force the water out. Ideally there will be a comfortable amount of moisture trapped just below the surface of the soil. If it stays muddy below the surface, you are in trouble.

                    There are entire books, sites, and fields of study devoted to soil nutrition and health. The short and dirty &#40;pun intended&#41; is:

                <p>The three key nutrients to watch for are: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and potassium. Each one has a tell in the plants leaves when there is a deficiency. These are also mobile nutrients, meaning they are water soluble. If your soil doesn't retain water, these nutrients will run off and out of your garden leaving the soil depleted. The best way to fight this is, compost, earth worms, and fungus. This combination will leave behind water retaining material that will leach off these broken-down nutrients for your plant's enjoyment. You can also introduce base minerals and bring the Ph of your soil to more alkaline by fertilizing with wood ash. Do not use the ash if treated wood, plywood, or plastics have been burned in the pit, they release toxins that can transfer into your food or kill your plants.</p>

               <p>Mushrooms are a great addition to a garden. They retain moisture, help fight pests, release valuable nutrients into the soil, and if you properly seed mushrooms in your garden, you can eat them too. There are two main ways you can utilize edible mushrooms on a small property. <a href="https://www.northspore.com">North Spore</a> and <a href="https://www.grocycle.com">Grocycle</a> are both excellent resources for information on how to do this. The two ways that I know of are</p>

            <div id="shroomculttxt">
                <h3>Direct cultivation</h3>
                <p> This method utilizes mushoroom towers, logs, or piles. Most of the edible mushrooms you find are wood loving fungus that vary in difficulty to grow. most of the ones you will be using for independent cultivation will be on wood that is not buried such as shiitake, oyster, or lion's mane. As the wood deteriorates and falls away, the scraps can be shoveled into the garden as fertilizer. The main advantages to this route are that you isolate the fungus you want and can cycle different fungus on the same wood when the first has depleted its environment. Oyster mushrooms are a great secondary species. The main Draw backs are, that they require a little more attention and they are prone to being picked over by local wildlife </p>

                <h3>In Garden cultivation</h3>                
                <p>This method involves inoculating wood chips or logs and burying them in the garden. This method requires a little less maintenance as it fertilizes the garden as it grows. The larger draw-back is that you will have to know for sure that the mushrooms you are picking are the ones you planted. Set up is a little more labor intensive as you have to bury the medium. They are also often more difficult to start. </p>
