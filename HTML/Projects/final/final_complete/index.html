                <h2>Why Would you want to do this?</h2>
               <p>There are a number of different reasons one would want to make a smaller plot produce food stuffs. Just having some clean food you grew at home is a rewarding and comforting feeling. However, there is also a practical application to producing on a small plot. With cities being the main areas that people live, not everyone gets an opportunity to make a large amount of land work for them. With inflation on the rise, pesticides, herbicides and genetically modified foods flooding the market, it becomes a point of prudence to make a smaller plot produce for you and your family. </p>

            <h2>But You Need Lots of Land to Produce Anything Meaningful!</h2>
            <p>This misnomer is 100% false. One zucchini plant takes up about 4ft diameter circle of space and can produce upwards of 15 zucchinis in a season. 1 healthy tomato plant can produce up to 50 tomatoes in a season. Preservation techniques and a small garden is capable of feeding a small family in a self-sustaining cycle. There are a ton of reasons to work your small plot the most important being the acquisition of skills for an emergency scenario.  </p>
